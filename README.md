# SERVERLESS [λ ➡️ ☁️]

Everything serverless related.

## Abstract
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing">Serverless</a> is a cloud-native development model that allows developers to build and run applications without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.
<br/>

In this paradigm, servers are **abstracted away** from app development. 
<br/>
A cloud provider handles the routine work of provisioning, maintaining, and scaling the server infrastructure.
<br/>
Developers can simply package their code in containers for deployment.

In addition to not having to worry about infrastructure and concentrating resources solely on writing code, 
<br/>
other advantages of serverless are that apps can automatically scale up and down as needed. 
<br/>

Serverless offerings from public cloud providers are usually metered on-demand through an event-driven execution model.
<br/> 
As a result, when a serverless function is sitting idle, it doesn’t cost anything.
